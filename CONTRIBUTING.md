Thank you for contributing! 

To help out, there are a couple basic things to know about github first. To add your own project, follow these steps: 

1. On the top of this project, Press "Add File > Create New File". 
2. For the filename, do "projects/your-team-name-YYYY/file" for every file. This means it's in your team's folder, and everything you do should be in this folder.
3. Before you submit anything, make sure click "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request". This means that everything you do is isolated from everyone else's projects.
5. When you're done, you can create a **pull request** and I can *pull* your project into the main repository, or you could wait. You can access this branch at any time via the button at the top left that says "main" (or the name of the branch you chose) until you pull it into main.  

That's it I think! Thanks for helping out :D
