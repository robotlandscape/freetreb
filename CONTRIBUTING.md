Thank you for contributing! 

To help out, there are a couple basic things to know about github first. To add your own project, follow these steps: 

1. On the top of this project, Press "Add File > Create New File". 
2. For the filename, do "projects/your-team-name-YYYY/file" for every file. This means it's in your team's folder, and everything you do should be in this folder.
3. Before you submit anything, make sure click "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request". This means that everything you do is isolated from everyone else's projects.
4. When you're done, you can create a **pull request** and I can *pull* your project into the main repository. 

That's it I think! Thanks for helping out :D
