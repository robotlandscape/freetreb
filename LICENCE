FREETREB DESIGN LICENCE

I'm not going to enforce this, and thus I'm not writing it in legal. But by looking at the designs here and reading this text, you are now obligated to put your own project here. Kind of like those bad "repost this or you will have bad luck!!1!" kind of posts, there's nothing bad that will happen if you don't put your design here, but if other people are giving their trebuchet designs in here and you're using them without giving back, it's kinda against the spirit of Treb Day. It's a project, not a competition, the only thing that matters is the quantity of water baloons that knock the glasses off of Mr. Kaplo. 

Good luck, may you find these resources useful, and please contribute back!
