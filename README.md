# Freetreb: Open Source Trebuchet Documentation

> It ain't cheating if it's allowed!

Are you building a trebuchet for your WHS Physics assignment? 

Do you have no idea how to build a trebuchet, hopelessly looking at designs online built by people just as frantic as you are? 

Is it October 25th and your trebuchet is still firing backwards? 

Are you thinking about sinking so low as to go to the Windham black market for trebuchets? 

*All of the above?*


### Look no further! 

This is a repository of fellow sleep-deprived trebuchet-builders to record and document what worked for them, what didn't, how they fixed problems, and what their final result was. Because trebuchet day is an assignment and not necessarily a competition, collaboration benefits everyone who contributes! 

So what we have to offer you is a repository of open source trebuchet designs, an in-depth showcase of what works, what worksn't, and how to build your own water balloon-launching instrument of carnage. 

## Before you continue...

My only condition for using this free resource is that you contribute back. If you find the information that I (and eventually others) have put here, then to have it be a fair trade, *please* put your own treb here. The Honor System applies. Don't cheat, don't take anyone's work verbatim. 

Mr. Kaplo is alright if you do your journal-work here instead of/in addition to your actual journal. 

If you have trouble using github itself, then take a look at the file CONTRIBUTING.md, it should tell you enough to get started on adding your treb here :D
