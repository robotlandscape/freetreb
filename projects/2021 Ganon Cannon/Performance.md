# Pre-First shot

Before we even arrived we came acknowledging that our trebuchet was in a sub-optimal place, but we decided to go with it anyway, thinking correctly that the 
majority of our tweaking would be better to do on-site. 

Day of, my partner and I set up the treb in the correct position. Super cold. First period comes and I go with a bunch of other students to help set up the castle. 

# First official shot

We were the first person to fire a water baloon :D We were ready and we wanted to be the first. It went into the B area. 

Many of our shots went like that, after a while we got into a system. However many of our shots were misfiring or going straight up. We didn't have a solution, 
we did have potential sources of the problem though, including the wheels, the release angle, and the sling. 

It was cold, we were kinda unhappy with where our treb was, and it wasn't all that great, but somehow our treb hit the exterior wall of the castle, and we were 
the first to get an A :D

# Second official shot

We still didn't have a solution to the firing-straight-up problem, but since the pressure was off from our first shot, we didn't worry too much about it, and we 
didn't try to solve it. We did a lot of practice shots though, and it was a bit embarrasing in hindsight because every other shot we'd have to shout "HEADS UP!"

We did, however, get into a system of getting it to misfire the least, a certain string arrangement. This didn't stop us from being the first to get a D in the
second shot with another misfire. (Being one of the lowest team numbers helps with all these "firsts")

# Third official shot

Dan from team #1 came to us shortly after this misfire and suggested that it could be a sling issue, and so we went to another team (I forget which one) and 
borrowed some gorilla tape that they had brought, and applied it to the bottom of our sling, the side that faced the sliding board (the black board in the CAD). 
I think that it was that the sling was releasing too early, or that sometimes the balloon would be in contact with the sliding board and pop there and then, or 
sometimes the balloon would wedge itself in the gap that we covered with the tape, to not release at all. 

After our fix, the balloon made it consistently into the castle, with the biggest variations coming from the wind. Unfortunately on our official shot, we did have
the wind working against us, so we got a B on the last shot. Given another shot I'm pretty sure we could have hit Mr. Kaplo, but I'm happy with how we did overall,
even if our *best* shot was a fluke.
