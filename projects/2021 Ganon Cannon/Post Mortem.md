# Post-mortem

This isn't anything that is required of the journal, these are a compilation of things we would have done differently if we had the chance. 

- The trestles could have been *inside* of the base, this would have probably made it sturdier. We didn't have any stability issues, but this would have made it stronger. 
- I think we drilled the holes for the counterweight arm too close to the axis on the swinging arm. I can't verify this as I don't have the trebuchet, but this probably made our ratio different, and our trebuchet less efficient. 
- I would have liked to have documented what we did better while we were doing it, but I get why I didn't (too in-the-moment). 
- I'm not going to have time to do the video, it would have been nice to have done that. 
- We should have had a better system for changing out the weights. 
- I think we should have maybe done a bit more research on sling designs. Ours worked fine in the end but not without modification.
