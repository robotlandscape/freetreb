HONOR SYSTEM: Please do your own work here. If you need to, feel free to use this as a reference, but do your own work and make sure you understand it. 

> Calculations including: X and Y components of velocity, initial velocity vector shown graphically (as the sum of the components) and calculated analytically, and maximum height. You will be supplied with the time of flight and range of your projectile.

I'll work in terms of variables for now, then substitute my values in afterwards. 

d = distance \\
t = time of flight \\
h = release height (it's not released from the floor!) \\
v_x = \\
