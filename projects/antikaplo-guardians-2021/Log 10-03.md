First log in the repository! (besides the template one). Granted, I'm writing this 3 days after this all happened, but that's fine. 

I went to my partner's house at 10, and we pretty much went straight to home depot to get the majority of the materials we thought we would need, 
which was 10 2-by-4s (and a 2-by-6 for the throwing arm, we thought it would be better if it was thicker for strength). We also bought 10 angle brackets
(we wound up being 2 short, as we found out later) and four wheels. 

We went to work, we built a rectangular frame for the bottom (dimensions will be a separate file), then two vertical pillars on either side. We reinforced this
with diagonal 2-by-4s (on the last one was when we realized we were short 2 angle brackets so we went back to home depot for those). The vertical pillars were a
little crooked so we spent the rest of the time fixing those, then we called it a day.
