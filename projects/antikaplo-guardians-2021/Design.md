> Each journal must contain... a written discussion of your major design considerations. Specifically, placement of the main axle on the throwing arm, throwing arm material and geometry, structural integrity, counterweight type, and sling fabrication and design. Modifications to design, experimentation and trials should also be discussed here.

Many of our design considerations were based on research we did online before starting the project. 

The main axle of our throwing arm was put at a ratio of 3.75:1, with 3.75 being the length of the throwing arm side of the main arm, and 1 being the side with the counterweight.
