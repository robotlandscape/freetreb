# Design

> Each journal must contain... a written discussion of your major design considerations. Specifically, placement of the main axle on the throwing arm, throwing arm material and geometry, structural integrity, counterweight type, and sling fabrication and design. Modifications to design, experimentation and trials should also be discussed here.

Many of our design considerations were based on research we did online before starting the project. We looked into several types of trebuchets, and almost did a whipper trebuchet, but opted for a normal one on the basis that it was better documented online. 

### Ratios

The main axle of our throwing arm was put at a ratio of 3.75:1, with 3.75 being the length of the throwing arm side of the main arm, and 1 being the side with the counterweight. 

### Materials

We opted to use maple 2 by 4's for most of the project, however we actually decided to get a single 2 by 6 for the throwing arm because we had heard a lot of 
stories from past years of throwing arms snapping. Therefore, we got a thicker plank of wood for that particular piece. 

### Structure

Structural integrity was something we took somewhat for granted, but we knew generally what we wanted. Each trestle was supported by triangles along the throwing axis. **However one thing I would do differently if I were to do this project again would be to have the supporting trestles inside the base**, because that way the base would almost act as a "pen" for the trestles to live in, versus what we have which is the trestles on top of the base, just screwed on. 

### Counterweight

The counterweight is 150 lbs of lifting weights. If I were to do this project again I'd have a system to modify the weight better, I saw some people with a basket that they put their weight in, which, although it didn't look as nice as ours, we didn't have as much flexibility to change them out as much (it was quite an ordeal to get the first ones on).

### Sling

The sling was made quite nicely out of some crocodile leather that my partner had lying around. We made it into an X shape, sowed it together, sowed each of the two arms together almost like an infinity sign, and added gromets to each end. We also added a piece of gorilla tape to the bottom of the sling (the side that dragged on the sliding board) to fix it releasing too early/late. 

### Release hook

The release hook (where the sling released the balloon was just a nail. We were going to do something fancy but ran out of time. Do a nail, it works fantastically and you can modify the release angle with a pair of pliers. 

### Beautification

As far as aesthetics goes, we gave the boring pale wood a nice varnish, added some Legend of Zelda symbolism to go with our theme, and painted our sliding board black. It looked quite nice!
