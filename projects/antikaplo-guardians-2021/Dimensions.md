# Dimensions

**THROWING ARM: 1.75 m** (hard limit)

## Planned dimensions

*these are slightly different from the real dimensions you'd find on our trebuchet, because of A. the width of the wood and B. how we arranged the materials, like
"should this piece go on top of this piece or beside it?"*

Base: 1.3125 \* 0.4370 m 

Trestle Height: 0.984 m (we went with a meter)

Throwing arm ratio: 3.75:1 (ratio of the length of the projectile end and the counterweight end)

Throwing arm lengths: 1.3815 m for projectile side, .3684 for counterweight side

The sling will be the same length as the projectile side of the throwing arm.

Counterweight will be about 75-100 times heavier than the mass we're throwing. how much will that be? don't know yet ðŸ™ƒ
