Today we got together and we figured out what kind of design we wanted to do. 
We made a list of what materials we needed, figured out what materials we could use from spare wood, and went to lowe's for the remainder. 
We're going to be making a whipper trebuchet. 

<also a bunch of dimensions that I don't feel like fabricating>
